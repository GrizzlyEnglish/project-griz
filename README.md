# project-griz
Currently, I want this to just be a simple static portfolio. I will use vue, so that if I do get to the point of adding in a "What I learned", or a blogging system, I can easily add components and extra pages.

# Tools
- Vue
- Express
- Node
- PostgreSQL (If I do the what I learned/blogs)

# Plans
- Wireframe website
- Build the canvas like dwitter background
- Build the boring portfolio part
- Build a "What I learned today" blogging system
- Actually blog stuff that nobody will ready
- Be done
